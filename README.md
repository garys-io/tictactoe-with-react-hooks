# Tictactoe with react hooks

## What

- I'm creating this file to follow through the [official react tutorial](https://reactjs.org/tutorial/tutorial.html) but using [react hooks]() instead of the old **Class**ical way

## Why

- To get up to speed with the new react.js features

## Process

1. Do the `create-react-app app` from the [offical docs](https://reactjs.org/docs/create-a-new-react-app.html#create-react-app)

1. Replace the default html, css and jsx with the one in [the codepen](https://codepen.io/gaearon/pen/oWWQNa)

1. Change the class components to functional

1. Add game logic

1. Extract the game logic into Redux like reducer into it's own file

1. Add unit tests for reducer by using [jest](jestjs.io)

1. Add [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org) for strong type and intellisense

1. Add [Material UI](https://material-ui.com/) to make the app look nicer
