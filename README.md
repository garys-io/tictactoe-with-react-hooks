# Tictactoe with react hooks

## What

- I'm creating this file to follow through the [official react tutorial](https://reactjs.org/tutorial/tutorial.html) but using [react hooks]() instead of the old **Class**ical way

## Why

- I haven't used used react.js in a while and want to get up to speed with the new features

## Process

1. Do the `create-react-app app` from the [offical docs](https://reactjs.org/docs/create-a-new-react-app.html#create-react-app)

1. Replace the default html, css and jsx with the one in [the codepen](https://codepen.io/gaearon/pen/oWWQNa)

1. Change the class components to functional
